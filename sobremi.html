        <h2>Sobre mi</h2>
        <p>My name is Julian, I'm 29 years old and I live in Bogota.<br>My life is almost all about two things: Physical training and creativity</p>
        <p>Physical training because I was bullied by my father when I was a child (fondly fortunately) <br> so I told my mom and dad that I wanted to start working out in a gym at 14 years old. <br> Later on I decided to study Cultura Fisica y Deporte<br>
        So I have almost 15 years of physical training over my back, I practice olympic weighlifting, <br> bodybuilding, running, basic gimnastics and calisthenics, and currently training/learning some of muay thay <br>
        besides the physical aspect, physical training makes me really happy, <br>and taught me the real meaning of discipline and what you can get with it</p>
        <p>Creativity because I love to create my own stuff.<br>I studied some graphic design as well so I got some base for creativity in those years. <br>
        My mom is a tailor so I learned some of her craft, now I am creating my own bussiness <br> where I design, sew and sell my products, functional stuff like bags, backpacks, chest bags, phone holders etc. </p>
        <p>Currently learning some of 3d design, german, muay thay, and programming. I'd like to create robots in the future</p>
